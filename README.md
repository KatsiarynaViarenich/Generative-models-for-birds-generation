# Generative-models-for-birds-generation
A diffusion model written from scratch for bird images generation.

Created with the help of the following resources:
- https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch
- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sjy9odlSSy0RBVgMTgP7s99NXsqglsU
- https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/annotated_diffusion.ipynb
- https://tree.rocks/make-diffusion-model-from-scratch-easy-way-to-implement-quick-diffusion-model-e60d18fd0f2e

The training is in process. The results will be shown soon.

Next steps: comparing the performance of diffusion models with Normalizing Flows and GANs.
