# Generative models for birds generation
A diffusion model written from scratch for bird image generation.
 
The dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species

To put all the images in one folder after loading the dataset, run the shell script located in data/birds_dataset.

Created with the help of the following resources:
- https://github.com/lucidrains/denoising-diffusion-pytorch
- https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sjy9odlSSy0RBVgMTgP7s99NXsqglsU

- https://tree.rocks/make-diffusion-model-from-scratch-easy-way-to-implement-quick-diffusion-model-e60d18fd0f2e

The training is in process. The results will be shown soon.

Next steps: comparing the performance of diffusion models with Normalizing Flows and GANs.
